# Button with Div Practice

This project is a simple web page designed to practice working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The page demonstrates basic interactions between buttons and `<div>` elements, allowing users to change the background color and text content of the divs through button clicks.

## Features

- **Change Color:** 
  - The "color change" button changes the background colors of two divs. 
  - `div1` changes from orange to blue, and `div2` changes from yellow to green.

- **Change Text:** 
  - The "text change" button changes the text content of the two divs.
  - The text in `div1` changes to "hello", and the text in `div2` changes to "bye".

## Project Structure

### HTML

The HTML structure includes:
- A heading (`<h1>`) to label the practice.
- Two divs (`div1` and `div2`) with initial background colors of orange and yellow.
- Two buttons that trigger JavaScript functions to change the color and text content of the divs.

### CSS
The CSS styles the heading, divs, and applies different background colors. It also defines the different classes used to change the div colors.

### JavaScript
The JavaScript includes two functions:
- changeColor(): Changes the background color of the two divs.
- changeText(): Changes the text content of the two divs.
